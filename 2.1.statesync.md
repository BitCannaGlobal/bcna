# State Sync - Client Script
Script to bootstrap the syncing when a new peer/validator join to BitCanna-Cosmos.

## The Problem
When a new peer tries to join a running chain it can take days to fully synchronise and this can take up a huge amount of disk space.

## The Solution
StateSync is a feature which would allow a new node to receive a snapshot of the application state without downloading blocks or going through consensus. Deploying the new State Sync function on StateSync servers could help to boost the synchronizing of new peers/validators. It also reduces the disk space usage. 

Bitcanna StateSync servers will include this function in mainnet. 

## There are two State Sync scripts: 
* For to sync a new peer/validator: `statesync_client_linux_new.sh`
* For to sync an existent peer/validator: `statesync_client_linux_backup.sh`

# Start to sync a new peer/validator 
We asume you are not running a validator or simple node so far.

1. Install `jq` and download the script:

    ```
    sudo apt install jq
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BitCannaGlobal/cosmos-statesync_client/main/statesync_client_linux_new.sh
    chmod +x statesync_client_linux_new.sh
    ```

2. Then launch the script (CTLR + C to stop it,):
Read carefully the instructions displayed at screen when you run it:
    ```
    ./statesync_client_linux_new.sh
    ```
### When your peer is synced, set up a service file if you hadn't it previously.
3. Move the binary to the system path:
    ```
    sudo mv .bcnad /usr/local/bin/
    ```
4. Setup `bcnad` systemd service (copy and paste all to create the file service):
    ```
    cd $HOME
    echo "[Unit]
    Description=BitCanna Node
    After=network-online.target
    [Service]
    User=${USER}
    ExecStart=$(which bcnad) start
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=3
    LimitNOFILE=4096
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    " >bcnad.service
    ```
    
5. Enable and activate the BCNAD service.
    ```
    sudo mv bcnad.service /lib/systemd/system/
    sudo systemctl enable bcnad.service && sudo systemctl start bcnad.service
    ```
6. Check the logs to see if it is working:
    ```
    sudo journalctl -u bcnad -f
    ``` 

### If you want to run a validator see this guide:
https://github.com/BitCannaGlobal/bcna/blob/main/README.md#3Create-a-validator

# Start to sync an existent peer/validator 

Follow this instructions only if you are running currently a validator/peer.

> It will reduces the disk space usage. From thousands of GB to MB maintaining your config and validator keys!

Don't start the BitCanna daemon manually, the script will do it for you and will synchronize the whole chain. 

Follow the instructions at the screen when the script starts. 
Press CTRL + C to stop it when you see the peer synced with last block. It could takes some minutes (from 2 to 4 minutes)

If you are running a validator/peer, this script will save space in disk for you, will backup your current data and config folder and resync in several minutes.

> **Very important**, daemon should turned off if is not a clean installation and `jq` tool must be installed in the system.

1. Install `jq` and download the script:

    ```
    sudo apt install jq
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BitCannaGlobal/cosmos-statesync_client/main/statesync_client_linux_with_backup.sh
    chmod +x statesync_client_linux_with_backup.sh
    ```

2. Then launch the script (CTLR + C to stop it):
    ```
    ./statesync_client_linux_with_backup.sh
    ```

3. If everything goes right, you can delete the backup folder and the backup configuration
    ```
    rm -rf .old_bcna #deletes old folder to save space in hard disk
    rm bcna_folder_backup_* #deletes backed config; you can also save it safely

## DISCLAIMER:
This script is experimental, StateSync is experimental, run it at your own risk, make your own backups of the configuration and do not run it before reading and understanding the contents of the script.
