# Install / Compile last BitCanna binary 
**bcnad** is a blockchain application built using Cosmos SDK v.0.45.8 and Tendermint v.0.34.21 and IBC-go v3.2.0.

In this guide you will find how to install the last binary or compile it by yourself.

* Before you start, you might want to ensure your system is up to date. Besides, you can install a utility named `jq` to read and navigate in JSON files and outputs.

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential curl wget jq
    ```
* Increasing the default open files limit.
If we don't raise this value, nodes will crash once the network grows large enough.
    ```
    sudo su -c "echo 'fs.file-max = 65536' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
    sudo sysctl -p
    ```
## Option 1. Download and install the last binary 
By downloading the binary we avoid compiling the source code.
1. Download the latest version (v.1.4.2) from Github:
    ```
    cd $HOME
    wget -nc https://github.com/BitCannaGlobal/bcna/releases/download/v1.4.2/bcna_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    ```
2. Check the sha256sum for the downloaded file. 
    ```
    sha256sum bcna_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    ```
    It must return: `903c63b9f668bf5208566955648279bdf0c15e73aab415d5ea5efc09ec1fc890`

3. Verify that the version is `1.4.2`
    ```
    rm -f ./bcnad #delete old file if exist
    tar zxvf  bcna_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    rm bcna_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    chmod +x bcnad
    ./bcnad version
    ```
4. Move the new binary to your machine's PATH and overwrite the previous version
    ```
    sudo mv bcnad $(which bcnad)   #copy&paste don't replace anything
    ```
    If you know the exact destination you could also run: 
    ```
    sudo mv bcnad /usr/local/bin/ #or wherever you have it
    ```

## Option 2. Compile instructions: 
### Install GoLang v1.18.x

The official instructions can be found here: https://golang.org/doc/install

1. Firstly, remove any existing old Go installation as root
    ```
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
    ``` 
2. Download the software:
    ```
    curl https://dl.google.com/go/go1.18.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -C/usr/local -zxvf -
    ```
3. Update environment variables to include Go (copy everything & paste)
    ```
    cat <<'EOF' >>$HOME/.profile
    export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    export GO111MODULE=on
    export GOBIN=$HOME/go/bin
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOBIN
    EOF
    source $HOME/.profile
    ```
4. To verify that Go is installed:
    ``` 
    go version
    ```
    Should return `go version go1.18.5 linux/amd64`

### Download source code and compile
5. Download the source code using `git`
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/BitCannaGlobal/bcna.git
    cd bcna
    git checkout v1.4.2
    make build   #it build the binary in build/ folder
    ```
6. Verify the version:
    ```
    build/bcnad version
    ```
    The output must be `1.4.2`

7. You now have two options:
    * Move the binary to the /usr/local/bin path with: 
        ```
        sudo mv build/bcnad /usr/local/bin/
        ```
    * Or compile and install the binary in the $GOPATH path:  
        ```
        make install
        ```
